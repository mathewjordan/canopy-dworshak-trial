Here the men are testing the bedrock and support to see if it is good enough to hand a high bridge to. The bridge will be 610 ft. above the river bottom. From this you will be able to see what the country looked like before the lake. Of course, this will never be seen in our lifetime unless somebody blasts the dam out!
