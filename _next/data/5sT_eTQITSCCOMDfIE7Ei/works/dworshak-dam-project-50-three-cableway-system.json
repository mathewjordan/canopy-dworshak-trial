Photo of artist's drawing. Note on back: \"Artist's painting of three-cableway system being used to place concrete in Dworshak Dam.  It is 2915 feet between the head towers (right) and tail towers (background). The bucket, weighing 25 tons with its load of concrete, travels across the river gorge at 2200 feet per minute and down the dam site at 950 feet per minute. The batch plants are at lower left. The sand and aggregate comes into the plants on conveyor belts. The fresh concrete is transported to the cableway loading dock in rail-mounted hopper cars. (Note bucket being loaded at middle right of picture.) Dworshak is being constructed under a $131-million contract by Dworshak Dam Constructors, a joint venture of five contractors sponsored by Dravo Corporation. From: Duane L.
